                Each person has its own preferences when it comes to brand, design, performance or
                any other attribute. You can imagine it is not different with motorcycles in this aspect.
                Many riders often have a very special relationship with their two-wheeled honey and it is
                no surprise that they are even pickier when it comes to choosing their road trip partner.

                <h3>SUPERMOTO</h3>
                <p>
                Just by looking at the profile of a supermoto, you'll notice the differences, with
                the biggest being the wheels. Supermotos lean more toward street performance and thus 
                have smaller wheels and thicker, wider tires to handle tighter turns and more speed. They 
                also have different gearing to get up to speed and bigger brakes for stopping power. 
                They maintain the more upright seating position of a dual sport.

                <h3>SPORTBIKE</h3>
                <p>
                There are 3 main classes for sportbikes: Lightweight, Middleweight and Superbike. This last one is 
                the one I personally prefer and will be refering on this small article. Superbike bike is a 
                general term given for the highly tuned performance motorcycle. So you can call a high end 
                street bike as superbike also. Superbike will give it's maximum performance at higher engine speed.
                These bikes are preliminary designed for track use.

                <h3>CAFE RACER</h3>
                <p>
                It is perhaps the most influential motorcycle movement the world has ever seen. Born in the
                streets of England in the 1950s, its culture still thrives around the globe. There will never be
                another motorcycle-or rider-quite like it. And yet, most of us have never heard of the cafe racer. 
                The cafe racer is both man and machine. With its Spartan appearance and aggressive styling,
                the cafe racer is one of the most distinctive and revered motorcycles in the world.

                <h3>CRUISER-TOURING</h3>
                <p>
                Cruisers are the ideal bike for those who don't want to blend in with the crowd. These 
                bikes often have larger, heavier frames so that they can hold bigger, more powerful engines. 
                Touring bikes are often built from cruiser frames but are specifically developed to offer more
                practical features for life on the road.Touring bikes may feature beefed up suspension, more 
                cargo room, and other features.
